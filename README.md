This is a simple portfolio website based on the [Udacity mockup](project_files/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf), written with
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome

It uses Bootstrap modals. It has some minor customization.

## TODO:

1. Fix images to be responsive, by using scrset.
2. Add fade-in over images.
3. Move source / demo / more info to the fade-in. Also have them inside modal.
4. Find an image to replace keyboard image, that works better with the blue background.
5. Create custom bootstrap files with only the functionality that I am using.
6. When done, switch to CDNs.
7. Add favicons for other devices.
8. Remove unused font files.
